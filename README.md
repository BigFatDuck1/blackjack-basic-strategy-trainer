# Blacjack Basic Strategy Trainer

## *Simple basic strategy trainer*

Dealer has one face-up card and you (player) have two face-up cards

Currently contains two sets of questions:

1. Hit/Stand only
Are questions where the correct answer is either hit or stand only

2. Random
Random basically generates a pair of cards and the dealer's face-up card, however, it is still a work in progress

Question taken from Blackjack Blueprint by Rick "Night Train" Blaine
